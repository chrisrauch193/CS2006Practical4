-- of pairs of position and the colour at that position.  So a 10x10 board 
-- for a game of 5 in a row with a black piece at 5,5 and a white piece at 8,7
-- would be represented as:

-- Board 10 5 [((5, 5), Black), ((8,7), White)]

{- Hint: One way to implement 'checkWon' would be to write functions 
which specifically check for lines in all 8 possible directions
(NW, N, NE, E, W, SE, SW)

In these functions:
To check for a line of n in a row in a direction D:
For every position ((x, y), col) in the 'pieces' list:
- if n == 1, the colour 'col' has won
- if n > 1, move one step in direction D, and check for a line of
  n-1 in a row.

-- return an integer indicating how good the board is for that colour.
