-- An important part of the AI is the 'gen' function you pass in here.

-- unmanageably large game tree!) it could, for example, generate moves
-- according to various simpler strategies.

{- Hint: 'updateWorld' is where the AI gets called. If the world state
 indicates that it is a computer player's turn, updateWorld should use
 'getBestMove' to find where the computer player should play, and update
 the board in the world state with that move.

 At first, it is reasonable for this to be a random move!

 If both players are human players, the simple version above will suffice,
 since it does nothing.

 In a complete implementation, 'updateWorld' should also check if either
 player has won and display a message if so.
